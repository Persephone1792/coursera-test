## Solutions

- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/Persephone1792/coursera-test/tree/gh-pages/Mod2%20solution) - You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.

- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/Persephone1792/coursera-test/tree/gh-pages/Mod3) - Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (the navbar should become invisible and is not fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). The navbar should have a company name (i.e., navbar-brand class).
For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. 
Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear. The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. [View](https://persephone1792.github.io/coursera-test/Mod3/index.html)
- [Assignment 4](https://github.com/Persephone1792/coursera-test/tree/gh-pages/Mod4_solution) - In this assignment, you are going to loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.

- [Assignment 5](https://github.com/Persephone1792/coursera-test/tree/gh-pages/Mod5_solution) - The front page of our web app contains 3 clickable tiles: Menu, Specials, and Map. If you click on the Specials tile, you will be taken to a single category page where all the menu items that belong to the Specials menu category will be shown. Your task in this assignment is to alter this behavior such that when the user clicks on the Specials tile, the web app takes the user to a random single category menu page, listing menu items in the category, be it "Lunch", "Dinner", "Sushi", etc. That way, any random category can become the Specials!
